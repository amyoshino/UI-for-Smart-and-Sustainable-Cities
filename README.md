# UI-for-Smart-and-Sustainable-Cities

Assignment #4 – due 4/17 – submitted to NYUClasses Urban Informatics for Smart, Sustainable Cities
NYU - Spring 2017
Prof. Kontokosta
Using sensor data from devices deployed in NYC and correlative data available from NYC Open Data, your assignment is to identify patterns and anomalies in environmental data, and find potential causal relationships between these indicators and the built environment. Air quality (particulate matter) and noise data have been posted to NYUClasses, along with locations of the devices taking the readings. You should:
1. Clean and plot the data for the individual sensors provided;
2. Describe the daily patterns that emerge;
3. Identify anomalous activity;
4. Link the sensor data back to city administrative records to identify possible correlations or
causal relationships.
-For air quality, you should examine the correlation between particular matter concentrations and temperature, humidity, and land use.
-For noise, you should analyze the relationship (If any) between noise level readings, 311 complaints about noise, and land use.
To do this, you will need to extract the relevant 311 data, land use (PLUTO) data, and weather data for the time period and locations covered by the sensor data.
There are two options for your submission:
(1) Submit your Python code and output (through Git is fine) that addresses the above
requirements. You should discuss your findings. You will be evaluated on the quality of the code and output.
